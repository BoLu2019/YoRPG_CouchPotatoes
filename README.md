#Protagonists:
   # 1. Warrior: This subclass of Protagonist that gives the user a high helth pool and defense. However, in return, the                         class's attack damage is lower than other classes. This class is great for long runs and is generally for                      less experienced players.


#Monsters:
   # 1. Slime: This subclass of Monster that has low attack and health. It is a fairly waek monster. However, in return,                       defense is EXTREMELY high because who can destroy a fluid with a physical attacks? This class is intented to                   waste the player time in order to keep players glued to their screens.
