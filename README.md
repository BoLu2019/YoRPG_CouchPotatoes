## Characters
# These three characters are all subclasses of Character.

# Protagonists:
   # 1. *Warrior*: This is a subclass of Protagonist that gives the user a high health pool and defense. However, in return, the                         class's attack damage is lower than other classes. This class is great for long runs and is generally for                      less experienced players.
   # 2. *Wizard*: Wizard class has all of the default stats, but is great with magic, so it has twice the attRating of a normal character.
   # 3. *Archer*: Archer class has slight higher than average of each stat; the balanced player.


# Monsters:
   # 1. *Slime*: This subclass of Monster that has low attack and health. It is a fairly waek monster. However, in return,                       defense is EXTREMELY high because who can destroy a fluid with a physical attacks? This class is intended to waste the player's time in order to keep players glued to their screens.
   # 2. *Goblin*: This monster has lots of armor from stealing from the heroes of the past. Not to mention it's skin has great durability, hence the higher health than others.
   # 3. *Gargoyle*: A creature which attacks ferociously but is killed more easily than others.
   
# New Additions in Version 5.0:
   # 1. Before and after every turn, the player's stats will be visible on the screen.
   # 2. A new action is added to the game: defending. Defending will increase the player's defense by a certain amount (this amount is a random fraction of the current defense added to the current defense), but the player's strength will also be decreased from the recoil (this value is determined by the multiplication of a random decimal and the current strength).
   # 3. Defending 3 times will result in a minor heal as the player recollects his/her thoughts (amt healed is a random fraction of the player's current health).
   # 4. Player's and Monster's stats have been modified to provide a more balanced(or unbalanced) gameplay.

# Without this, we would not be able to play our amazing creation.
