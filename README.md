## Characters
# These three characters all subclasses of Character.

# Protagonists:
   # 1. *Warrior*: This subclass of Protagonist that gives the user a high health pool and defense. However, in return, the                         class's attack damage is lower than other classes. This class is great for long runs and is generally for                      less experienced players.
   # 2. *Wizard*: Wizard class has all of the default stats, but is great with magic, so it has twice the attRating of a normal character.


# Monsters:
   # 1. *Slime*: This subclass of Monster that has low attack and health. It is a fairly waek monster. However, in return,                       defense is EXTREMELY high because who can destroy a fluid with a physical attacks? This class is intended to waste the player's time in order to keep players glued to their screens.
   # 2. *Goblin*: This monster has lots of armor from stealing from the heroes of the past. Not to mention it's skin has great durability, hence the higher health than others.
